This is for the googel codein project
THis is my first time doing this so its a good learning experience
WHen I created a github account I went to github.com and filled out the infomation to create one 
I clicked on their 4 step boot camp after that to help finish the other steps. 
when i clicked to create a repository or in other words a project i entered the name i wanted it to be 
and a short description which was the initial comments 
In order to switch a branch or in other words a copy of my project that can be merged together later
i had to create one which i called test
i follow the steps they had me do to fork a repository which is basically copying someone elses project
i made some changes and sent it back to them so they can decide if they wish to keep the changes this is called pull request

# code-in-repo
first repository
